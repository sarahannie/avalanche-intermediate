# Avalanche-Intermediate-Module-3

This is the third project within the Avalanche-Intermediate series. For this project, my objective is to develop a smart contract for generating a custom token. Once the contract is established, I will employ Remix to engage with it. Within Remix, the proprietor of the contract ought to possess the capability to mint tokens to a specified address. Likewise, any user should retain the ability to burn and transfer tokens.

## Getting Started

### Requirement

- Remix IDE

### Executing program

#### Remix IDE

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the code into the file. Compile and deploy the contract, then interact with the deployed contract.
